### 1. Amazon 6-Pager Structure

| Section | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Executive Summary** | BLUF - the decision/recommendation | 1 paragraph |
| **Context** | Background needed to understand | 1/2 - 1 page |
| **Current State** | What's happening now | 1/2 - 1 page |
| **Proposal** | What you recommend | 1-2 pages |
| **Alternatives** | Other options considered | 1/2 page |
| **Next Steps** | Specific actions needed | 1/4 page |
| **Appendix** | Supporting data | As needed |

### 2. SCQA Framework

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | Stable context everyone agrees on | "We've grown 40% YoY..." |
| **Complication** | Disruption creating tension | "...but churn is increasing..." |
| **Question** | The decision needed | "...should we invest in retention?" |
| **Answer** | Your recommendation | "Yes, and here's how..." |

### 3. BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

**Structure**:
```
[Recommendation/Decision] because [key reason].

[Supporting context]

[Details]

[Next steps]
```

### 4. Executive Email Format

```

## Fractional PM Context

### Your Role as Fractional PM

Executive communications is high-value fractional work - many PMs struggle to communicate "up":

| Fractional Value | How to Deliver |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Framework Introduction** | Teach SCQA, BLUF, 6-pager structure |
| **Draft Assistance** | Create first drafts for important communications |
| **Coaching** | Review and improve their exec communications |
| **Template Creation** | Build reusable templates for common scenarios |

### Engagement Boundaries

**Your job**: Draft communications, teach frameworks, create templates, coach on executive writing
**Client's job**: Deliver the communications, own the message, handle follow-up, build relationships

**Critical distinction**: You draft, they deliver. Never be the voice of the client to their executives.

### Common Engagement Patterns

| Scenario | Your Role |
|----------|-----------|
| **Board Update** | Draft initial version, they review and own |
| **Exec Proposal** | Structure the argument, gather their input |
| **Stakeholder Email** | Provide template, they personalize and send |
| **Decision Document** | Facilitate content gathering, draft, they finalize |

### Ghostwriting Ethics

| Acceptable | Not Acceptable |
|------------|----------------|
| Drafting and they review/edit | Sending on their behalf without review |
| Creating first versions | Being the ongoing voice for all exec comms |
| Teaching frameworks | Creating dependency on your writing |
| Templates they can reuse | Communications only you can produce |

### What Full-Time vs. Fractional Does

| Full-Time PM Does | Fractional PM Does |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Writes all exec comms themselves | Teaches frameworks, reviews key docs |
| Owns ongoing stakeholder updates | Creates templates for updates |
| Handles day-to-day exec communication | Coaches on high-stakes communications |
| Builds relationships through communication | Advises on relationship-building approach |

### Warning Signs (Scope Creep)

- You're writing all their exec communications (dependency)
- They can't write a board update without you (should be coaching)
- You're sending emails on their behalf (they should send)
- Executives know you better than your client does (relationship misalignment)

### Deliverables You Leave Behind

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 6-Pager Template | Reusable executive memo structure |
| Board Update Template | Standard board communication format |
| Executive Email Templates | Common high-stakes email patterns |
| SCQA Framework Guide | Reference for structured communication |

## Guidelines

- Lead with the recommendation, not the journey
- If they only read one paragraph, what must they know?
- Every claim needs supporting data
- Every recommendation needs alternatives considered
- Every action needs an owner and date
- Cut 50% of your words after first draft
- Write for scanning, not reading
- Anticipate and address objections proactively
- **Fractional**: You draft, they deliver - never be their voice to their executives
- **Fractional**: Teach frameworks, don't create writing dependency
- **Fractional**: Leave behind templates they can use without you
