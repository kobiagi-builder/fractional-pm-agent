## Core Frameworks

### 1. WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT

**The Universal Structure**:

| Element | Purpose | Time Allocation |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **WHAT** | The information/idea | 30% |
| **SO WHAT** | Why it matters to them | 40% |
| **NOW WHAT** | What to do next | 30% |

**Application**: Works for any speaking situation - presentations, updates, answers to questions.

### 2. Presentation Structure (10-minute talk)

```
Hook (30 sec) → Problem (2 min) → Solution (3 min) → Evidence (3 min) → CTA (1 min)
```

| Section | Purpose | Key Elements |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Hook** | Grab attention | Surprising fact, question, story |
| **Problem** | Create tension | Pain articulation, stakes |
| **Solution** | Provide path | Your answer, approach |
| **Evidence** | Build credibility | Data, stories, testimonials |
| **CTA** | Drive action | Clear next step |

### 3. Anxiety Management

**Reframe Anxiety as Excitement**:
- Same physiological response
- Label it as excitement, not nervousness
- "I'm excited to share this"

**Pre-Talk Rituals**:
- Arrive early, own the space
- Power poses (private)
- Deep breathing (4-7-8)
- Positive visualization

### 4. Q&A Handling

**Response Structure**:
```
Acknowledge → Bridge → Answer → Evidence → Check
```

| Step | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Acknowledge** | Show you heard | "That's an important question..." |
| **Bridge** | Connect to your message | "The key issue here is..." |
| **Answer** | Respond directly | "My recommendation is..." |
| **Evidence** | Support the answer | "We've seen this work when..." |
| **Check** | Confirm satisfaction | "Does that address your concern?" |

### 5. Impromptu Speaking (Problem-Solution-Benefit)

When caught off guard:
1. **Problem**: State the issue/context
2. **Solution**: Offer your perspective/approach
3. **Benefit**: Explain the positive outcome

## Fractional PM Context

### Your Role as Fractional PM

Presentation coaching is valuable fractional work - many PMs need help with high-stakes presentations:

| Fractional Value | How to Deliver |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Framework Introduction** | Teach WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT structure |
| **Content Development** | Help structure their presentation content |
| **Rehearsal Partner** | Practice runs with feedback |
| **Q&A Preparation** | Anticipate tough questions, prepare responses |

### Engagement Boundaries

**Your job**: Structure content, coach delivery, prepare for Q&A, provide feedback
**Client's job**: Deliver the presentation, own the message, build the relationship with their audience

**Critical distinction**: You coach, they present. Never present on their behalf to their stakeholders.

### Common Coaching Scenarios

| Scenario | Your Role |
|----------|-----------|
| **Board Presentation** | Structure content, rehearsal coaching, Q&A prep |
| **Customer Pitch** | Positioning help, practice sessions, objection handling |
| **Internal Launch** | Narrative development, delivery coaching |
| **All-Hands Update** | Message framing, confidence building |

### What Full-Time vs. Fractional Does

| Full-Time PM Does | Fractional PM Does |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Gives presentations regularly | Coaches for high-stakes presentations |
| Builds presentation skills over time | Accelerates skill development for key moments |
| Owns relationship with audience | Prepares them to own the relationship |
| Handles impromptu speaking daily | Teaches frameworks for impromptu situations |

### Coaching vs. Presenting

| Acceptable | Not Acceptable |
|------------|----------------|
| Structuring their presentation | Presenting to their stakeholders |
| Running practice sessions | Being their ongoing presentation creator |
| Preparing Q&A responses | Fielding questions in their meetings |
| Teaching frameworks | Creating presentation dependency |

### Warning Signs (Scope Creep)

- You're giving presentations on their behalf (they should present)
- They can't present without your preparation (should be building skill)
- You're attending all their key presentations (dependency)
- Stakeholders see you as the presenter, not coach (role confusion)

### Deliverables You Leave Behind

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Presentation Template | Reusable WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT structure |
| Q&A Preparation Guide | Framework for anticipating and handling questions |
| Confidence Checklist | Pre-presentation routine they can use |
| Speaking Notes Template | How to create effective speaking notes |

### High-Value Coaching Moments

Fractional PMs add most value in presentation coaching when:
- Stakes are high (board, investors, major customers)
- Client lacks presentation experience
- Time is limited and preparation must be efficient
- Confidence is low and needs building

## Guidelines

- "Structure sets you free. When you have a framework, you can focus on connecting, not remembering." - Matt Abrahams
- Lead with what matters to them, not what matters to you
- Pause longer than feels comfortable - it feels right to the audience
- The first 30 seconds set the tone - start strong
- Anxiety is excitement with different labeling
- Three key points maximum - more and they won't remember any
- Stories beat statistics for memorability
- Practice out loud - silent reading doesn't prepare you
- **Fractional**: You coach, they present - never present on their behalf
- **Fractional**: Build their skill, don't create presentation dependency
- **Fractional**: Leave behind frameworks they can use for future presentations
